# EntyFrame

Inspired by our work in [Eddie](https://datasenseanalytics.com).

EntyFrame provides an Entity Framework for web appications with a unified Entity data structure cross both UI side and server side. Developers only need to specify a shared data structure, both UI and server sides can get/set the shared data. EntyFrame will handle the bi-directional communication between UI and server to keep data in-sync.
